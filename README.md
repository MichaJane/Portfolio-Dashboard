# Portfolio Dashboard

A personal portfolio dashboard that is built with Angular and Angular Material. It aim to showcase my projects, skills and experience in a more dynamic and business-like than a traditional resume.

The goal is to start as my **personal portfolio** and later upgrade it with **more features** that make it useful to other users. This dashboard will continue to evolve as I improve my skills and explore new tools and features.

⚠️ **Note**: This project is still **In progress**. The design, layout and features will continue to improve in upcoming updates.

## Notes

- For now, this project is built for **personal use only** to showcase my portfolio.
- All data is currently hardcoded in Angular services/components as it's not connected to any API.
- In future updates, the goal is to connect it to backend or API so data can be more dynamic.
