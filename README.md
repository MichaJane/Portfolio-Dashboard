# Portfolio Dashboard

A personal portfolio dashboard that is built with Angular and Angular Material. It aim to showcase my projects, skills and experience in a more dynamic and business-like than a traditional resume.

The goal is to start as my **personal portfolio** and later upgrade it with **more features** that make it useful to other users.

⚠️ **Note**: This project is still **In progress** and the design/layout will continue to improve in upcoming updates. Some features are not yet fully implemented and some information are temporary placeholder.

This dashboard will continue to evolve as I improve my skills and explore new tools and features.

## Current Features

- **Dashboard overview**: Welcome card, highlights, and basic stats (projects, experience, skills).
- **About section**: Profile card and more detailed highlights.
- **Projects section**: Categorized into _In progress_, _Upcoming_, _Completed_ and with basic stats.
- **Contact form**: EmailJS (validation improvements ongoing).

## Notes

- For now, this project is built for **personal use only** to showcase my portfolio.
- All data is currently hardcoded in Angular services/components as it's not connected to any API.
- In future updates, the goal is to connect it to backend or API so data can be more dynamic.
